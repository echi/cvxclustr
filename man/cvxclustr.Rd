\title{Convex Clustering via Splitting Methods}
\description{
  Clustering is a fundamental problem in science and
  engineering. Many classic methods such as $k$-means,
  Gaussian mixture models, and hierarchical clustering,
  however, employ greedy algorithms which can be entrapped
  in local minima, sometimes drastical suboptimal ones at
  that. Recently introduced convex relaxations of $k$-means
  and hierarchical clustering shrink cluster centroids
  toward one another and ensure a unique global minimizer.
  This package provides two variable splitting methods
  \itemize{ \item{Alternating Method of Multipliers (ADMM)}
  \item{Alternating Minimization Algorithm (AMA)} } for
  solving this convex formulation of the clustering
  problem. We seek the centroids u_i that minimize \deqn{
  \frac{1}{2} \sum_i || x_i - u_i||_2^2 + \gamma \sum_l
  w_{l} ||u_{l1} - u_{l2} || } Two penalty norms are
  currently supported: 1-norm and 2-norm.
}
\details{
  The two main functions are
  \code{\link{cvxclust_path_admm}} and
  \code{\link{cvxclust_path_ama}} which compute the cluster
  paths using the ADMM and AMA methods respectively. The
  function \code{\link{cvxclust}} is a wrapper function
  that calls either \code{cvxclust_path_admm} or
  \code{cvxclust_path_ama} (the default) to perform the
  computation.

  The functions \code{\link{kernel_weights}} and
  \code{\link{knn_weights}} can be used in sequence to
  compute weights that can improve the quality of the
  clustering paths.

  The typical usage consists of three steps \itemize{ \item
  Compute weights \code{w} \item Generate a geometrically
  increasing regularization parameter sequence.
  Unfortunately a closed form expression for the minimum
  amount of penalization to get complete coalescence is
  currently unknown. \item Call \code{\link{cvxclust}}
  using the data \code{X}, weights \code{w}, and
  regularization parameter sequence \code{gamma}. }
