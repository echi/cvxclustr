#cvxclustr

The R package `cvxclustr` implements two variable splitting methods (ADMM and AMA) for solving a convex formulation of the clustering
problem.

## Remarks

Details on the algorithms are in the paper [Splitting Methods for Convex Clustering] (http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0499) by Chi and Lange.
