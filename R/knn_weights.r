#' "Thin" a weight vector to be positive only for its k-nearest neighbors
#' 
#' \code{knn_weights} takes a weight vector \code{w} and sets the ith 
#' component \code{w[i]} to zero if either of the two corresponding nodes
#' is not among the other's \code{k} nearest neighbors.
#' 
#' @param w A vector of nonnegative weights. The ith entry \code{w[i]} denotes the weight used between the ith pair of centroids. The weights are in dictionary order.
#' @param k The number of nearest neighbors
#' @param p The number of data points.
#' @author Eric C. Chi, Kenneth Lange
#' @export
#' @return A vector \cite{w} of weights for convex clustering.
