#' Convex Clustering via Splitting Methods
#' 
#' Clustering is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. Many classic methods such as $k$-means,
#' Gaussian mixture models, and hierarchical clustering, however, employ greedy algorithms which can be
#' entrapped in local minima, sometimes drastical suboptimal ones at that. Recently introduced convex relaxations
#' of $k$-means and hierarchical clustering shrink cluster centroids toward one another and ensure a unique global minimizer. 
#' This package provides two variable splitting methods
#' \itemize{
#' \item{Alternating Method of Multipliers (ADMM)}
#' \item{Alternating Minimization Algorithm (AMA)}
#' }
#' for solving this convex formulation of the clustering problem. We seek the centroids u_i that minimize
#' \deqn{
#' \frac{1}{2} \sum_i || x_i - u_i||_2^2 + \gamma \sum_l w_{l} ||u_{l1} - u_{l2} ||
#' }
#' Two penalty norms are currently supported: 1-norm and 2-norm.
